			<p>Sondland, Volker, Perry, and Taylor are to call Zelensky. Sondland wants the call to be unmonitored and untranscribed. After the call, Volker is to meet with Zelensky on July 2 to make things clear that Volker is seeking cooperation on Investigations.</p>

			<p>U.S. Participants: Bolton, Volker, Sondland, Perry, Hill, Griffith (?), Vindman, and another assistant to the president (?).</p>
			<p>Ukrainian participants: Danylyuk, Yermak, Danyluk's advisor.</p>
			<p>When Sondland started to speak abut Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with POTUS, Bolton cut the meeting short.</p>
			<p>[Paraphrasing of Sondland] "In order to get a white house meeting, the Ukrainians would have to provide a deliverable which is investigations, specific investigations" - Vindman</p>
			<p>At this point in time, the connection to POTUS isn't clear to Vindman.</p>
			<p>It was clear there was an agreement between Sondland and Mulvaney that Zelensky would get the White House meeting if the Ukrainians undertook these investigations.</p>
			<p>Bolton gets upset and cuts the meeting short, claiming those running the meeting should have nothing to do with domestic politics. He characterizes the meeting as a "drug deal", and tells Hill to speak to lawyers about the meeting.</p>
			<p>Volker thinks everyone thought the comments were inappropriate. Volker doesn't think investigating Burisma is related to investigating Bidens.</p>

			<p>No change in official policy. (Taylor?) learns the hold comes from Mulvaney.</p>
			<p>Volker and Giuliani meet. Volker says Lutsenko is not credible and serving in a self serving capacity. Giuliani agrees, and wants investigations. Volker says nobody in the new team governing Ukraine was involved in things back then because they were not yet involved in politics and were instead "making television shows". Volker says Biden is too honest to get personally involved, but that Ukrainian election interference might be possible.</p>
			<p>"I talked to Zelensky just now. He is prepared to receive POTUSâ€™s call. Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation, and will turn over every stone. He would greatly appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he can put out some media about a friendly and productive call. No details. Prior to Ukraine election on Sunday." - Sondland email to pompeo, Perry, McCormack, Kenna, Mulvaney, Blair. Mulvany responds "I asked the NSC to set it up for tomorrow."</p>

			<p>Volker introduces Giuliani and Yermak via a phone call.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>July 25</h4>
			<p>Second phone call between Zelensky and POTUS (9am east coast). Zelensky speaks a little English (he is still learning), but mostly Ukrainian. Zelensky requests more missiles, POTUS says "I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it." ... "The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution and if you can look into it... It sounds horrible."</p>
			<p>Vindman makes talking-points for the call and is with Williams, and Morrison (others too?) in the situation room listening to the call. Taylor did not receive a record of this call.</p>
			<p>The publicly available transcripts of this call are edited and imperfect. Some content and words have been changed and some have been removed.</p>
			<p>Vindman had concerns and felt obligated to report this to people in the chain of command. "It was improper of the president to demand an investigation into a political opponent. Especially with a foreign power where there's at best dubious belief that this would be a completely impartial investigation. And that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge, be perceived as a partisan play, undermine Ukraine policy, and undermine our national security."</p>
			<p>Williams first time hearing POTUS talk about Investigations. Previously she had heard about this from Giuliani's press interviews. She notes the references to Biden are political in nature.</p>
			<p>Corruption (broadly or generally) is not brought up or discussed, although Burisma specifically is.</p>
			<p>"Heard from the White House, assuming president Zelensky convinces POTUS he will investigate / get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck!"- Volker to Yermak. This happened before the phone call between presidents.</p>
			<p>Morrison feared how the call's disclosure would play in Washington's political climate.</p>
			<p>2:31PM (EST?) email says Ukrainian embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee are asking [DoD] about security assistance. 4:25PM email says the Hill knows about the FMF (foreign military financing) situation to an extent and so does the Ukrainian embassy.</p>
			<p>DoD staff et email from Ukraine embassy asking what is going on with aid.</p>

			<h4>July 26</h4>
			<p>Morison says the July 25 call "Could have been better"</p>
			<p>POTUS suggests Zelensky and his staff meet with Giuliani and Bar.</p>
			<p>Sondland's call with POTUS is overheard by Holmes. "So he's going to do the investigation?" is the only thing POTUS asks about Ukraine, before moving on to topics of a different country/issue.</p>
			<p>Sondland tells Holmes "[POTUS] doesn't give a fuck about Ukraine. He only cares about big stuff...  ... big stuff that benefits the President, like the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing"</p>

			<h4>August 10</h4>
			<p>Once we have a date [for the White House meeting] we will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of the US-Ukraine relationship, including among other things, Burisma and election meddling in investigations. - Yermak to Sondland.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>August 11</h4>
			<p>"[Pompeo], [Volker] and I negotiated a statement from Zelensky to be delivered for our review in a day or two. The contents will hopefully make the [POTUS] happy enough to authorize an invitation. Zelensky plans to have a big [press conference] on the openness subject, including specifics next week." All of which referred to the 2016 and the Burisma. - Sondland</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>August 16</h4>
			<p>Yermak asks the US to submit an official request for and investigation into Burisma breaking Ukrainian law if that is what the US wants. First draft seen by Volker has no mention of Burisma or 2016, but Giuliani tells Volker and Sondland that there should be mention of Burisma and 2016, but Biden's name doesn't come up.</p>
			<p>The above paragraph needs clarification. It comes from two source and they conflict in dates, or maybe my notes are bad.</p>
			<p>Taylor thinks this is improper, and suggests we steer clear.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>August 22</h4>
			<p>(Call) Taylor asks Morrison if there had been a change in policy of strong support for Ukraine, to which he responded: It remains to be seen. Morrison also said POTUS doesn't want to provide any aid at all.</p>
			<p>Taylor had previously claimed he would resign if strong support for Ukraine changed, and was now preparing to do so.</p>

			<h4>September 1</h4>
			<p>Zelensky meets with Pence in Warsaw.</p>
			<p>Zelensky stars meeting by asking about aid. Pence says Ukraine has unwavering US support, and would bring it up to POTUS that night. Pence says POTUS wants Europeans to provide more support, and Ukrainians to do more to fight corruption.</p>
			<p>Before the meeting, Taylor tells Danylyuk if the White House doesn't lift the hold on the aid by September 30, the funds would expire and Ukraine would receive nothing.</p>
			<p>Sondland tells Yermak the aid would not come until Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.</p>
			<p>Sondland tells Taylor POTUS wants Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and 2016 election interference. Sondland says he made a mistake by telling the Ukrainians only the White House meeting was conditional upon Investigations when in fact everything is dependent upon that, including aid. Sondland says POTUS wants Zelensky in a "public box". Taylor asks Sondland to push back on POTUS and that perhaps the Ukrainian prosecutor make the announcement instead.</p>
			<p>Taylor first learns aid is conditioned on investigations.</p>
			<p>Danylyuk meets with Morrison, concerned about the possible loss of US support. The Ukrainians are troubled by the lack of answers to explicit questions about aid.</p>
			<p>Zelensky forms a parliment. They have a 24 hour session. Might have pushed through many anti-corruption measures?</p>

			<p>POTUS tells Sondland he is not asking for a quid-pro-quo, but "[POTUS] did insist Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations into Biden and the 2016 election interference and that Zelensky should want to do this himself."</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>September 7 / 8 (?)</h4>
			<p>Sondland speaks with Zelensky and Yermak, saying although this was not a quid pro quo, if Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate. Meeting ends with Zelensky saying he will make a public statement on CNN</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>September 9</h4>
			<p>Taylor says Ukrainian faith in the US is shaken, and that is crazy to withhold military aid for help with a political campaign.</p>
			<p>Sondland says POTUS has been clear there is no quid-pro-quo of any kind. Says the Ukranians need to pay up before POTUS will sign the check.</p>
			<p>"But as of September 9th you understood, did you not, that President Trump, either himself or through his agents, required that President Zelensky make a public announcement of the two investigations that President Trump cared about in order to get both the White House meeting and to release the security assistance. Is that correct?" - Goldman. "I believe that is correct" - Sondland. Sond</p>
